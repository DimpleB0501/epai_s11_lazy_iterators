# Lazy iterators
In this assignment we worked towards modifying the polygons sequence type into an iterable. <br/>
Rather than using a list to iterator over, as we did in the [previous assignment (class notebook)](https://github.com/DimpleB0501/epai5_iterable_iterators_part1/blob/main/iterators_iterables.ipynb) and its corresponding python [Polygons Iterator Class](https://github.com/DimpleB0501/epai5_iterable_iterators_part1/blob/main/iterators_iterables.ipynb) code. <br/>
In this assignment we implemented a lazy iterator (using Polygon class rather than a list). The advantage of directly using the Polygon class is calculations/ processing is invoked only when the class is called.

### Results
![op](lazy_iterator.py)

### Codes
[ipython notebook](), main code,
[polygon](), properties of the polygon class are calculated here,
[polygons](), lazy iterator and a polygons sequence is implemented here.
